      </div>
      <div class="col-lg-8">
        
        <p>The history of Sree Padmanabhaswamy Temple dates back to 8th century. It is one of the 108 sacred Vishnu temples or Divya Desams in India. Divya Desams are the holiest abodes of Lord Vishnu that are mentioned in the works of the Tamil Azhvars (saints). The presiding deity of this temple is Lord Vishnu, reclining on Anantha, the hooded Serpent.</p>
        <p>Marthanda Varma,  noted among Travancore kings, did a major renovation to the temple and it resulted in the present day structure of the Sree Padmanabhaswamy Temple. It was Marthanda Varma who introduced the Murajapam and Bhadra Deepam festivals in the temple. Murajapam, which literally means continuous chanting of prayers, is still conducted in the temple once every six years.</p>

      <div class="col-lg-8">
        <p>Residents of the capital city of Thiruvananthapuram swear by the vibe and atmosphere at the Shankhumugham Beach. Some come here to view sunsets, while others drop by during the day to simply relax, with a majestic view and a calming breeze playing perfect hosts. Its rustic charm is enhanced by the fishermen thronging the place, along with a bunch of delightful vantage points which seem to have been specifically created for picnickers. For company, you have the matsyakanyaka sculpture (a gigantic, 35 m long mermaid structure), among the most unique constructions in the entire State and a special Indoor Recreation Centre and a beautiful Children’s Park.</p>

      <div class="col-lg-8">
        <p>As you step past the gates of the Zoological Park in Thiruvananthapuram,an immediate hush falls as all the visitors collectively draw in their breath in awe. There is a furry Macaque staring right back at you while a little ahead the exotic Nilgiri Langur playfully teases you. In a few more steps it dawns on you; you are in a literal jungle, right in the heart of the city.
          Said to be among the oldest of its kind in all of Asia, the zoo was built under the reign of the former ruler of Travancore, Swathi Thirunal Rama Varma. Dated to about 1857, one can still see some of the older structures that have been renovated over time. The finest avian species, brought here from around the world, dazzle your senses with an exorbitant display of colours. Throughout your walkyou are under a canopy of massive trees like mahogany, teak and fig. There is a pond at the heart of the zoo where one can view nesting Pelicans, Storks and Herons in their natural habitat.</p>
