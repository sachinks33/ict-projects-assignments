      <div class="col-lg-8">
        <p>Spread over a sprawling area of 344 sq. km., Wayanad Wildlife Sanctuary is the personified version of famous wildlife sanctuaries in the South. The wildlife sanctuary is a small part of Nilgiri Biosphere Reserve. There are two parts of the wildlife sanctuary- Muthanga towards the east partnering with Tamil Nadu and Tholpetty in the north side bordering Karnataka. The terrains of the forest can be best explored by sitting on the back of an elephant or hopping in a jeep safari. The national park spring back to life during monsoon, at this time group of elephants; roam freely here and there without any intrusions. Muthanga region in Wayanad area is great for elephant sightings, often in the thick bamboo groves flanking the main road. </p>

        <h4>Edakkal Caves</h4>
      </div>
      <div class="col-lg-8">
        <p>Superbly set in an enclosed area, the caves of Edakkal lures tourists in large number. Edakkal was deserted for about a millennium, as the forest shielded the caves. The structure of the cave date back to the Neolithic era and was discovered by Fred Fawcett in 1890 when he was on a hunting trip. Literal meaning of the term Edakkal is 'stone in between' and is completely synonymous. The cave was formed when a huge rock fell on two small boulders forming a gallery that is 90 feet high and 20 feet wide. The natural light emitting from the two caves makes the place look for dramatic and attractive.</p>
