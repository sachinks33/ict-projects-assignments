        <h4>Hill Palace Museum</h4>
      </div>
      <div class="col-lg-8">
        <p>Located about 10 kms from Kochi, the Hill Palace Museum was the official residence of the erstwhile rulers of Kochi. Built in 1865, it is now famous for being a full-fledged Ethno-Archaeological Museum and Kerala's first ever Heritage Museum. The palace complex itself comprises 49 buildings and is built in the traditional Kerala style of architecture. It has over 52 acres of terraced land around it.
          One can see oil-paintings, murals, sculptures, manuscripts and belongings of the Kochi royal family. Antique ceramics from the Far East, Kudakkallu  (tombstone), Thoppikkallu (hood stone), laterite memorials and wooden memorials from ancient civilisations like the Indus Valley and Harappa can also be found here. It even has a gallery housing contemporary art. It is our pride to have relics of such value and significance placed here. </p>

      <div class="col-lg-8">
        <p>Marine Drive is among the most beautiful and popular destinations in Kochi. It is frequented by locals and visitors alike due to the magnificent view of the backwaters and Kochi Harbour available here. The walkway is perfect to enjoy a relaxing stroll at any time of the day. Around the location, numerous restaurants and malls have come up which make it the de facto stop for shoppers as well. There are several boat jetties along the way and the International Boat Jetty Complex is situated here as well. 
          At night, the great Rainbow Bridge comes to life with vibrant lights and viewing it at this time is highly recommended. The entire area is a unique specimen of manmade wonders interspersed with natural gifts right in the midst of a sprawling metropolis.</p>

        <h4>Fort Kochi Beach</h4>
      </div>
      <div class="col-lg-8">
        <p>The Fort Kochi beach, with its clean premises and tranquil atmosphere, is frequented by tourists as well as the local people.
          There are many factors that differentiate the beach from the other beaches of Kerala. The presence of the Chinese fishing nets is probably the most easily identifiable one. The trees and the greenery on the walkway to the beach add to the serene atmosphere there. It is on these beaches that the famous Cochin Carvinal is conducted on New Year’s Eve.
          The sea food, the Vasco da Gama Square adjacent to the beach, a light house and a granite walkway are the other main attractions. The beach also gives you a breathtaking view of the sunset. If you are lucky, you may glimpse cargo ships passing through the sea. The remains of the Fort Immanuel can also be seen here. A section of the beach is not accessible to visitors as it is under the control of the Indian Navy.</p>

        <h4>Thattekkad Bird Sanctuary</h4>
      </div>
      <div class="col-lg-8">
        <p>Constituted during 1983, Dr. Salim Ali, the world famous ornithologist, is directly responsible for the wonders on display at the Thattekkad Bird Sanctuary. His famous survey of Travancore in the 1930s led to the formation of this modern day paradise for avian life. He noted that the area was rich in bird diversity and ought to be turned into a sanctuary to conserve the same. The over 300 species that reside in these tropical and deciduous forests are testament to his great vision.
          One can run across the Sri Lankan Frogmouth, Racket Tailed Drongo, Bronzed Drongo, White-bellied Treepie, Shama, Yellow-browed Bulbul, Rufous Babbler, Malabar Parakeet, White-bellied Blue Flycatcher and the Malabar Grey Hornbill in these parts. Beautiful teak, rosewood and mahogany plantations can also be viewed here. It also boasts of over 28 mammal species and over 9 species of reptiles.</p>
